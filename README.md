# Maestro

Maestro is repository for my personal astrophotograpy stacking and editing suite built in python


## Ideas to implement

- Use affine transformations for photo stacking offsets
- Use jax for photo editing
- Consider using multi-processing for data loading
- Automatic detection of common imaging issues (i.e. chromatic abberation, poor white balance, coma, etc
